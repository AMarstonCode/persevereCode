# HTML II
### The Adventures of Link
---

### Project Skills

* Linking html pages together using anchor (`<a>`) tags.
* CSS Flexbox

### Basic Setup

Our project will consist of a series of .html pages that we can link together using anchor tags.
Each page after the first one will:
* have a unique filename ending with `.html`.
* have the same title in its `<title>` tag as every other page.
* have, as its heading, the text of the anchor tag from the previous page that the user clicked on to get to _this_ page.
* have some "main text" that describes what happens once the user takes the action that got them there.
* have at least one link (but preferably more!) that describes a possible action.
* have a link _that opens a new window/tab_ and leads to the GitHub repo for your app on your last page of the story.
Any pages COULD have, but do not HAVE TO have:
* a link back to the first page
* an image -- set min
* basically whatever else you want

### Format Guidelines

* There is no minimum or maximum on the number of pages to make. Whatever feels done for the story you're telling.
* But however many pages it ends up being, `commit` for every completed page.

### Content Guidelines

How the story progresses from that initial page is totally up to you, as is its length. There are no stretch goals here, per se; just keep making pages that expand your story!
Some content guidelines:
* As always, keep it [SFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work).
* You should whenever possible branch out and give the user at least two choices for how to progress.
* You can use ChatGPT for creativity.
Good luck!
